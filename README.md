### Introduction
This project was a first taste of being able to combine my previous profesional work in theatre with my new field of engineering! This was one of those possibilities I talked about when I first started GA. Samantha Southard is my partner and she was struggling with Word Press as I was planning to start a career change after the effects of the pandemic. This is by no means a final product but a very fun first attempt at sharing in her continued theatrical career.


### Southard's Inventory 
Southard Theatrical is set up to recognize Samantha as the owner. Adding garments and images into the inventory is protected from anyone else using or editing.  

The inventory can then be displayed, like below, for any guest to view. If the guest wants to sign up any user can then communicate with Samantha to negotiate rental or build details.

### Users
Users of the site can comb through all of the available inventory.  Make a list of items that are currently "On the Rack" and available for rent. Or get a sense of Samantha's style and abilities to negotiate more specific work outside of the rentals.

### Upcoming
The next steps we hope to add to the site are:

- Adding multiple pictures per garment.
- Users who are looking to rent can click per item to compile a rental list to submit.
- Additional sections where users can submit information for full costume builds too.
- A page to show costumes used in various productions.
- Additional FAQ and info sections.

### This Project Used
